                <p>
                    Public Wi-Fi offers convenience but often comes with serious security risks. Understanding security protocols and vulnerabilities is essential for protecting your personal data when connecting to these networks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page provides an overview of common security terms and the threats faced by users when using public networks.

                    <h2>1. Older Protocols are Weak</h2>
                    <p>
                        WEP, once widely used, is now obsolete due to its reliance on a single, static encryption key that is easy to crack. WPA, although more secure, can still be compromised through brute-force attacks.

                    <h2>2. Weak Passwords are Risky</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even modern protocols like WPA2 can be vulnerable if users create weak passwords, enabling attackers to execute dictionary attacks.

                    <h2>3. Fake Wi-Fi Networks</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hackers often set up fake Wi-Fi hotspots with names similar to legitimate networks. Once users connect, their data can be intercepted using man-in-the-middle attacks. Always verify the network's name with the establishment providing it.

                    <h2>4. Packet Sniffing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Without proper encryption, data transmitted over public Wi-Fi can be captured and analyzed by attackers using packet sniffing tools. This includes sensitive information like login credentials and personal emails.

                        <li>Always use HTTPS websites to encrypt data transmissions.</li>
                        <li>Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (e.g., banking, email) on public Wi-Fi.</li>
                        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for critical accounts.</li>
                        <li>Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure browsing.</li>
                        <li>Turn off automatic connection to public Wi-Fi networks.</li>
